        <li><strong>1968</strong> -  During an interview with local publisher, Peter Bander van Duren, Terry mentioned a book he was working on (The Carpet People).

        <li><strong>1971</strong> -  The Carpet People was published, with the launch party held in the carpet department of Heal’s on Tottenham Court Road. </li>
        <li><strong>1983</strong> -  Terry’s very first Discworld novel, The Colour of Magic, was published by Colin Smythe – the start of what would become a phenomenally successful series, 41 books strong and translated all over the world.</li>
        <li><strong>1987</strong> - With the Discworld series now four books long and becoming more and more successful, Terry was able to give up his job at the Electricity Board to become a full time writer.</li>

        <li><strong>2002</strong> -  Terry won the Carnegie Medal for his children’s book <i>The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents</i>. Despite the many other awards, honorary degrees and knighthood that followed, he always said that this was the award he was most proud of. </li>
        <li><strong>2007</strong> -  Terry was diagnosed with a rare form of Alzheimer’s, Posterior Cortical Atrophy. He decided to tell the world, and began his campaign to raise awareness of the disease, donating a million dollars to Alzheimer’s research the following year. </li>

        <li><strong>2011</strong> -  Terry presented a documentary on assisted dying, Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die, in which he travelled to Switzerland to witness the death of terminally ill motor neurone sufferer Peter Smedley at the Dignitas clinic.
